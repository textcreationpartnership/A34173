            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Motives which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me to this.</head>
            <p>I Obſerved that the wit and induſtry beſtowed on the Scriptures, that of the Fathers and the more moderne was moſt in perſpective and meditation, <note place="margin">Voluptatem quandam in iis legendis ex illa rerum varietate percipere ſed de illarue imitatione ne cogitare qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, Machiv. lib disp. in Proaem.</note> ſet the Pulpit apart, I meane Preaching, ſo as they made the Scripture the Sabbath of their pennes recreating in the divine fancies and contemplations, but I know none that made the ſixe dayes worke of it, and reduced it into practice for the conduct and adminiſtration of action; <hi>David</hi> ſtiles it <hi>A Lampe unto the feet,</hi> not ſo much to the head, the contemplative part, as to the feet the active.</p>
            <p>I obſerved too, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Politician <note place="margin">Machiavil.</note> brought his
<pb facs="tcp:46639:3"/> veſſel to this holy ciſterne and drew ſome ſacred Aphoriſmes, though too few for action, rather devoting his penne to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Live</hi> for copy and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than hither.</p>
            <p>I obſerved againe that ſome had beſtowed themſelves on <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi> and on the Italian Hiſtory as <hi>Gaicciardine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Lipſius</hi> who deſerves much in this hath gone a ſuccinct and ſpeedy way in his Politicks, but all his draughts and copies were from heathen examples and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, <hi>Haud uſquequaque conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienter ad hoc aevum</hi> as hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not faſhioned for us and our times.</p>
            <p>I obſerved alſo that among the ancient, <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Arist tle</hi> had not beene a little painfull in their Politicks, but their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts were of a great latitude for common-wealths and nations, not ſtrait laced enough for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affaires, and ſo <hi>Zenephon</hi> and the reſt.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:46639:3"/>
            <p>Theſe kindled in mee an holy indignation, when I was ſtill converſant with a more faithfull and ſacred Oracle, therefore I ſet my ſelfe to the ſtudy of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and drew from thence theſe ſhort formes from the individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and particulars there, which though ſmall, yet like ſeeds, <hi>So explicant,</hi> they are ſpreading and diffuſive, and ſuch things as are drawne from particulars, ſayes our learned Authour, <note place="margin">Bacon. lib. de Aug. Scien.</note> know the beſt way to particulars againe.</p>
            <p>For methode I thought it the beſt to obſerve none, for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how independent, contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and emergent affaires are, I held it the beſt to keepe time with the variety, in theſe which I intend for their conduct and adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>For the brevity heere, I drew theſe copies rather in tablets than a larger ſpace, <hi>Legem bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vem eſſe oportet que iubeat;</hi>

                  <p>The true practice is a ſacred and ſerious deliberation and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the moſt fit meanes, an exact examination of time, place, and perſons, and of all ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as may bee in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of your affaires, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of what you doe to the copy in the Scriptures.</p>

                  <p>Thus,
